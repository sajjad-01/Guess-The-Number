# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the user receives feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

## Implementation Details
- The game is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated for each game.
- User guesses are compared to the correct number, and feedback is provided accordingly.
- The game resets after each correct guess.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
